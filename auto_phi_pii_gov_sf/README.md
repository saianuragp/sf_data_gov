| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto_tag_phi_columns.py` | Python script to auto-detect and tag PHI/PII columns based on regex |
| `masking_policy_templates.sql` | SQL templates for common masking policies (SSN, Email, Phone, etc.) |
| `row_access_policy_templates.sql` | Templates for region- or role-based access filtering |
---

## üß∞ Features

- ‚úÖ **Auto-tagging engine** using Snowflake column metadata
- ‚úÖ Easy-to-apply masking policies with role-based redaction
- ‚úÖ Ready-to-use templates for row-level security
- ‚úÖ Designed for **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold)
- ‚úÖ Compliant with HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2 governance best practices

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saianuragp/sf_data_gov.git
cd sf_data_gov/auto_phi_pii_gov_sf
```

### 2. Set Up Snowflake Credentials

Update the ```auto_tag_phi_columns.py``` script with your Snowflake account details:

```python
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user='YOUR_USER',
    password='YOUR_PASSWORD',
    account='YOUR_ACCOUNT',
    warehouse='YOUR_WAREHOUSE',
    database='YOUR_DATABASE',
    schema='YOUR_SCHEMA'
)
```

### 3. Run Auto-Tagging

```python
python auto_tag_phi_columns.py
```




Certainly! Below is the **complete, ready-to-paste `README.md`** file for your GitHub repo focused on automating PHI/PII governance in Snowflake using Python and SQL.

You can copy this directly into your repository.

# üßä Snowflake PHI/PII Data Governance Toolkit

A plug-and-play toolkit for automating **PHI/PII protection** in Snowflake using dynamic masking, tagging, and policy enforcement ‚Äî designed to work seamlessly with **Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold)**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Perfect for healthcare, insurance, fintech, and any regulated data workloads in Snowflake.

---

## üì¶ What's Included

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `auto_tag_phi_columns.py` | Python script to scan columns for PHI/PII patterns and apply tags |
| `masking_policy_templates.sql` | Snowflake masking policy examples (email, SSN, phone, etc.) |
| `row_access_policy_templates.sql` | Row-level access policies based on geography or role |
| `data_governance_playbook.md` | A compliance checklist across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers |
| `examples/` | Sample outputs and usage walkthroughs |

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Automatic tagging of PHI/PII fields using regex pattern matching
- Plug-and-play masking policies (fully/partially masked by role)
- Row access filtering for geo-restriction or role-based segmentation
- Secure by design for Medallion Lakehouse patterns
- Built with HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2 alignment in mind

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/snowflake-phi-governance.git
cd snowflake-phi-governance
````

### 2. Configure Snowflake Credentials

Edit the `auto_tag_phi_columns.py` file with your Snowflake credentials:

```python
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user='YOUR_USER',
    password='YOUR_PASSWORD',
    account='YOUR_ACCOUNT',
    warehouse='YOUR_WAREHOUSE',
    database='YOUR_DATABASE',
    schema='YOUR_SCHEMA'
)
```

### 3. Run Auto-Tagging Script

This script identifies columns like `email`, `ssn`, `dob`, etc., and applies a tag (`PHI_TAG` = 'YES').

```bash
python auto_tag_phi_columns.py
```

> üìù You can customize the regex dictionary in the script to match your organization‚Äôs naming standards.

## üîê Apply Masking Policies

Example: Email masking policy (partial redaction based on role):

```sql
CREATE MASKING POLICY mask_email AS (val STRING)
  RETURNS STRING ->
    CASE
      WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_PRIVILEGED') THEN val
      ELSE CONCAT('xxxxx@', SPLIT_PART(val, '@', 2))
    END;

ALTER TABLE patient_data
MODIFY COLUMN email
SET MASKING POLICY mask_email;
```

Other masking policies provided include:

* `mask_ssn`
* `mask_phone`
* `mask_dob`
* `mask_based_on_role`

---

## üß™ Row Access Policy Template

```sql
CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY region_filter
  AS (region STRING) RETURNS BOOLEAN ->
    CURRENT_REGION() = region;

ALTER TABLE patient_data
ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY region_filter ON (region);
```

> You can also scope access by `user`, `department`, or `classification`.

## üìã Governance Playbook Overview

| Layer      | Focus                              | Controls                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Bronze** | Raw ingestion of PHI/PII           | Tagging, limited access    |
| **Silver** | Cleaned, structured sensitive data | Masking, RLS, RBAC         |
| **Gold**   | Analytics-ready, governed output   | Views only, access history |

Full checklist in: `data_governance_playbook.md`

---

## üìå Example Use Case

üè• A healthcare company unintentionally exposed PHI from Silver to a Gold dashboard. After applying this toolkit:

* All PII/PHI fields were tagged + masked dynamically
* Analysts only saw masked data via secure views
* Role hierarchy + access logging were enforced

‚è±Ô∏è Time to remediate: <48 hours
